I"i<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">E</span>ach day, for the last two years, WHOOP has provided me with advanced analytics and insights on my body's strain, recovery, and sleep. WHOOP does a phenomenal job giving me the information I need to improve my performance, whether it's learning how to sleep better, train smarter, or take better care of my body. I know anecdotally that my behavior has changed as a result of WHOOP, but I wondered how much and in what ways. As a data-person, I decided to try to answer that question myself by downloading my data from the WHOOP website and visualizing it over time.</p>
