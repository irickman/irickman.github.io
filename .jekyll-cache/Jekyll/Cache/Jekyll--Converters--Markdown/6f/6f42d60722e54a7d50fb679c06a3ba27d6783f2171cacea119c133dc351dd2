I"­<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he English Premier League (EPL) is back for the 2017-2018 season, so to honor the occasion, I've put together a visualization to help prospective fans select a team to support, based on American professional team allegiance. To align American teams to EPL teams, I used an unsupervised learning technique called K-Means clustering, to group like teams. For the first league in the series, I decided to start with Major League Baseball (MLB), since it's currently ongoing, but I hope to soon follow with the NFL, NBA, and NHL. For now, enjoy learning about the wonderful world of Premier League football, through the lens of the MLB. </p>
