I"N<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>bout a month ago, Juan Soto was up to bat with a two strike count, in the first inning of a Washington Nationals game. While I watched on TV, the color commentator, F.P. Santangelo, said that he thought Juan Soto was actually a better hitter with two strikes. As a fan of the game and a fan of data analysis, I respectfully disagreed. I looked up his numbers and saw that with two strikes, Soto was hitting .177, while hitting .301 overall. Clearly, he's a better hitter without two strikes, so I tweeted at Santangelo to share the news. </p>
