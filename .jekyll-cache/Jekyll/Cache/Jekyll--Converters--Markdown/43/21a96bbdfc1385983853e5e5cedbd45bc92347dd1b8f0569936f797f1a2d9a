I"ç<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>round this time each Major League Baseball season, games stop for the All-Star break and players get a chance to rest and reflect on the first half of their season. In some cases it can be a chance to reset following a poor first half, while for others it's a chance to double down and continue stroking.
