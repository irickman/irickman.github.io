Because Capital Bikeshare has about twice as many docks as bikes, they "rebalance" their docks by moving bikes from full stations to empty stations to redistribute the location of bikes. In a later post, I will more comprehensively detail my methodology and capstone approach, but here I simply mean to display my findings and cover some interesting recommendations. </p>
