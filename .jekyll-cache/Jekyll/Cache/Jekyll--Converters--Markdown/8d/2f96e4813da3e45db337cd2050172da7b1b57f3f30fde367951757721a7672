I"<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span> few months ago, I was introduced to the magic that is The Great British Bake Off. Currently in its 8th season, the show is quite simple. Twelve of the best amateur bakers in the United Kingdom, come together each weekend to compete in an elimination style baking competition, to win the coveted title of UK's best amateur baker and the spoils that come with it ... aka a cake stand. While at first glance the show is pretty bland, the bakes prove to be anything bundt so. </p>
