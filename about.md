	<p class="intro">I'm a Data Lead for Federal Government projects who studied data science at <a href= "https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> in DC. </p>
	<p>I have experience making user-centric visualizations and implementing models into production on client site, so I'm hoping to use this site to expand my skillset through personal projects.</p>
