	<p class="intro">I'm a federal government consultant currently on sabbatical to study data science at <a href= "https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> in DC. </p>
	<p>I've got experience making user-centric visualizations, so I'm hoping to build up my technical chops and expand my analytical toolbox so I can understand and analyze increasingly challenging problems. I'll use this site to post about my efforts!</p>
